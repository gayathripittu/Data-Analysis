## Coffee Sales Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic and interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard in Excel, showcasing the use of advanced data analysis techniques and visualization tools.

#### Project Overview
The dashboard provides insights into coffee sales trends, customer preferences, and geographical distribution of sales. By combining and analyzing data from three CSV files—Orders, Customers, and Products—the dashboard delivers a comprehensive view of business performance.

#### Key Features

**Data Integration:**
Combined columns from multiple CSV files using `**XLOOKUP**`, `INDEX-MATCH`, and nested functions to unify the dataset into a single workbook for analysis.

**Data Analysis:**
Applied nested IF and IFS functions for conditional logic.
Used aggregation functions like SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT to summarize and derive key metrics.

**Visualizations:**
Created a time-series graph to visualize total sales trends over time.
Designed bar charts for sales by country and top customers.
Interactive slicers for filtering by roast type, size, loyalty card, and date range.
